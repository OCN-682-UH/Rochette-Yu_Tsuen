# Load the Data
This week we have a data set about country codes. Not very inspired unfortunately... 
```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-11-12')

countries <- tuesdata$countries
countries
#country_subdivisions <- tuesdata$country_subdivisions
#former_countries <- tuesdata$former_countries
```

# Introduction: A New Secret Code 
This week I wanted to use the name of the countries and convert them into a sequence of coded letters just like DNA is.  

To do that, I decided to use the letters K, R, Y and T (my initials) as my "nucleotides". The nucleotides will grouped by 3s, i.e. the codons, and each codons will be assigned a letter.

```{}
#Creating 28 sequences of 3 letters with the nucleotides. 
codon <- replicate(28, paste0(sample(c("K", "R", "Y", "T"), 3, replace = TRUE), collapse=""))

# Creating a vector with the letters of the alphabet, 
# an apostrophy and an underscore (as a space)
alpha <- c(letters, "_", "'")

# Assigning the letters a codon. 
gen_code <- tibble(alpha, codon)

# Because the codons where generated random and we want to have a consistant 
# genetic code, I save the matched letters and codons as a csv.
write_csv(gen_code,here("Tidy_Tuesday", "tidy_tuesday_3", "data", "gen_code.csv"))
```


# Load the Genetic Code
```{r}
gen_code <- tibble(read_csv(here("Tidy_Tuesday", "tidy_tuesday_3", "data", "gen_code.csv")))

gen_code
```


# Creating a Function that Will Convert our Country Names to "DNA Sequences"
```{r}
KRYT_DNA <- function(data, name = name ){
  data %>% tibble() %>%
    
    #the country names must be cleaned up before they can be encoded
    mutate(name_trans = tolower({{name}})) %>% # transform to lower case
    mutate(
      #spaces are replaced by a "_"
         name_trans = str_replace_all(name_trans, " ", "_"),
      # because this is a simple code, we will transform
      # any punctuation symbol as a "_" for the sake of simplicity 
         name_trans = str_replace_all(name_trans, ",", "_"),
         name_trans = str_replace_all(name_trans, "\\(", "_"),
         name_trans = str_replace_all(name_trans, "\\)", "_"),
      # we create a new column that splits the name of the countries into
      # their letter components. This returns lists.
         alpha = str_split(name_trans, "", simplify = FALSE)) %>%
    # we undo the list the letters can be manipulated
    unnest(alpha) %>% 
    # we can match the letter to the genetic code
    left_join(gen_code, by = "alpha") %>% 
    # and group the letters and codons by country names so they are kept tidy
    group_by(name_trans) %>% 
    # in order to group the codons together, we make a list with them
    mutate(DNA_seq = list(codon)) %>% 
    # we use map_chr(), which is a hidden for loop that applies a function to an object.
    #that way we can have the codon read one after the other to make a single string
    mutate(DNA_seq = map_chr(DNA_seq, ~ str_c(.x, collapse = ""))) %>% 
    #we only keep the relevant columns
    select(name, name_trans, DNA_seq) %>% distinct() %>%  
    # I had to ungroup or my later table gets messy
    ungroup()
}
```


## Examples ! 
We can make random lists of countries from this week's data set to test the function 
```{r}
test_1 <- countries %>% select(name) %>% slice_sample(n= 20)


KRYT_DNA(test_1) %>% 
  # create the gt table with a title and subtitle
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**Converting Country Names into Secret Messages**"))  %>%
  
  # change the column names into prettier names
  cols_label(
    name = "Country Name",
    name_trans = "Transformed Name",
    DNA_seq = "KRYT DNA Code") %>% 
  tab_source_note("Source: Tidy Tuesday November 12, 2024") %>%
  
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"), 
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything())) %>% 
  
  # center text within the columns 
  cols_align(
    align = "left",
    columns = everything())
```

```{r}
test_2 <- countries %>% select(name) %>% slice_sample(n= 20)


KRYT_DNA(test_2) %>% 
  # create the gt table with a title and subtitle
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**Converting Country Names into Secret Messages**"))  %>%
  
  # change the column names into prettier names
  cols_label(
    name = "Country Name",
    name_trans = "Transformed Name",
    DNA_seq = "KRYT DNA Code") %>% 
  tab_source_note("Source: Tidy Tuesday November 12, 2024") %>%
  
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(weight = "bold"), 
    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything())) %>% 
  
  # center text within the columns 
  cols_align(
    align = "left",
    columns = everything())
```


# Tidy Tuesday 3 Learnings
This week I wanted to play more with strings and getting to manipulate them.
It was pretty difficult to read a string letter by letter especially if those are part of a data set.  
There was a lot of googling and inquiries with chatgpt to understand the underlining priciples behind manipulating strings.  
One caveat of the function is that the new genetic code does not encompass every type of characters. If a country name has special characters such as "é", "ê" or "-", the DNA sequence cannot be generated. 


## **Conclusion:** I wish my research never involves having to deal with strings. (One can only dream!)
